# Project Name

Pig Game

# Project Overview

This project is a "Pig Game" where players collect scores by rolling dice. Players accumulate points with each roll but lose their current round score if they roll a 1. The game, originally styled with plain CSS, has been upgraded to use Tailwind CSS for a modern design. Additionally, the JavaScript code has been refactored to improve readability and performance, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
